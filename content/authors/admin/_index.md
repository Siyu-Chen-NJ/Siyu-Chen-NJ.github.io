<!-- I am a second-year MS student in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Lab, KAIST AI. I am supervised by Prof. Sung Ju Hwang. -->
I'm a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://sidilab.net/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration:none">**System Integration & Design Informatics Laboratory (SiDi Lab)**</a> in UT Austin. Prior to joining SiDi Lab, I was working on multi-agent systems consensus tracking control and learning-based optimal control at ITR Lab, the Technical University of Munich in Germany. I am currently working on multi-agent reinforcement learning and its application in team dynamics in design and task planning.
